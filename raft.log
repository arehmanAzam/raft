The University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley,
Berkeley, Cal, or California),[11][12] is a public land-grant
research university in Berkeley, California. It was established in
1868 and is the state's first land-grant university. It is a founding
member of the Association of American Universities and is the
foundi ng campus of the University of California system. Berkeley
has the most top-ranked departments nationally and is one of the
highest-ranked uni versities worldwide.[13][14]
Berkeley is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universitiesâ€”Very
high research activity" and hosts multiple research institutes.[15] It
played a major role in the Manhattan Project and the discovery of
sixteen chemical elements. It also has three national laboratories for
the U.S. Department of Energy (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los
Alamos National Laboratory).[16] Berkeley's athletic teams (the
California Golden Bears) have won 107 national championships
and 223 O lympic medals (including 121 gol d medals).[17][18]
Among Berkeley's alumni, faculty, and researchers are 260
American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellows,[19] 190
recipients of the MacArthur Fellowship,[20] 144 members of the
National Academy of Sciences,[21] 139 Gugge nheim Fellows, 107
Nobel laureates,[22] 75 members of the National Academy of
Engineering,[23] 68 recipients of the National Medal of Science, 34
Pulitzer Prize winners, 25 Turing Award winners, 22 cabinet
members, 19 Academy Award winners, 14 Fields Medalists, 10
state gove rnors, 7 heads of state or gove rnment, 6 chief justices,[24]
and 25 living bi llionaires.[25]
Made possible by President Lincoln's signing of the Morrill Act in
1862, the University of California was founde d in 1868 as the
state's first land-grant university, inheriting the land and facilities of
the private College of California and the federal-funding eligibility
of a public agricultural, mining, and mechanical arts college.[26]
The Organic Act states that the "University shall have for its
design, to provide instruction and thorough and complete educationHistory

courses of instruction in preparation for the professions".[27][28]
Ten faculty members and forty male students made up the fledgling
university when it opened in Oakland in 1869.[29] Frederick
Billings, a trustee of the College of California, sugge sted that a
new campus site north of Oakland be named in honor  of Anglo-
Irish philosophe r George Berkeley.[30] The university began
admitting women the following year.[31] In 1870, Henry Durant,
founde r of the College of California, became its first president. With the completion of North and South Halls in 1873,  the
university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 22
female students.[32][33] The first female student to graduate was in
1874, a dmitted in the first class to include women in 1870.[34]
Beginning in 1891, Phoebe Apperson Hearst funde d several
programs and new buildings and, in 1898, spons ored an
international competition in Antwerp, where French architect Ã‰mile
BÃ©nard submitted the winning design for a campus master plan. Although the University of California system does not have an
official flagship campus, many scholars and experts consider
Berkeley to be its unofficial flagship. It shares this unofficial status
with the University of California, Los Angeles.[35]
In 1905, the University Farm was established near Sacramento,
ultimately becoming the University of California, Davis.[36] In
1919, Los Angeles State Normal School became the southern
branch of the university, which ultimately became the University of
California, Los Angeles.[37] By the 1920s, the number of campus
buildings in Berkeley had grown substantially and included twenty
structures designed by architect John Galen Howard.[38] In 1917,
one of the nation's first ROTC programs was established at
Berkeley[39] and its School of Military Aeronautics began training
pilots, including Jimmy Doolittle. In 1926, future Fleet Admiral
Chester W. Nimitz established the first Naval ROTC unit at
Berkeley.[40] Berkeley ROTC alumni include former Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara, Army Chief of Staff Frederick C. Weyand, sixteen other general officers, ten Navy flag officers, and
AFROTC alumna Captain Theresa Claiborne.[41]
In the 1930s , Ernest Orlando Lawrence helped establish the
Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory) and invented the cyclotron, which won him the Nobel
phys ics prize in 1939.[42] Using the cyclotron, Berkeley professors20th centurySather Tower (the Campanile) looking
out over San Francisco Bay and
Mount Tamalpaisand Berkeley Lab researchers went on to discover sixteen chemical
elementsâ€”more than any other university in the world.[43][44] In
particular, during World War II and following Glenn Seaborg's
then-secret discovery of plutonium, Lawrence's Radiation
Laboratory began to contract with the U.S. Army to develop the
atomic bomb. Physics professor J. Robert Oppenheimer was named
scientific head of the Manhattan Project in 1942.[45][46] Along with
the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley founde d and
was then a partner in managing two other labs, Los Alamos
National Laboratory (1943) and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (1952) . In 1952, the University of California reorganized itself into a system
of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus given a
chancellor, and Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first Chancellor,
while  Robert Sproul remained in place as the President of the
University of California.[47] Berkeley gained a worldwide
reputation for political activism in the 1960s. In 1964, the Free
Speech Movement organized student resistance to the university's
restrictions on political activities on campusâ€”most conspicuously, student activities related to the Civil
Rights Movement.[48][49]
The arrest in Sproul Plaza of Jack Weinberg, a recent Berkeley alumnus and chair of Campus CORE,
prompted a series of student-led acts of formal remonstrance and civil disobedience that ultimately gave rise
to the Free Speech Movement, which movement would prevail and serve as a precedent for student
oppos ition to America's involvement in the Vietnam War.[50][51][52] In 1982, the Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute (MSRI) was established on campus with suppor t from the National Science Founda tion
and at the request of three Berkeley mathematiciansâ€”Shiing-Shen Chern, Calvin Moore, and Isadore M. Singer. The institute is now widely regarded as a leading center for collaborative mathematical research,
drawing thous ands of visiting researchers from around t he world each year.[53][54][55]
In the current century, Berkeley has become less politically active, although more liberal.[56][57] Democrats
outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of nine to one, which is a ratio similar to that of American
academia generally.[58] The school has become more focused on STEM disciplines and
fundraising.[59][60][61] In 2007, the Energy Biosciences Institute was established with funding from BP and
Stanley Hall, a research facility and headqua rters for the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences,
opened. Suppor ted by a grant from alumnus James Simons, the Simons Institute for the Theory of
Computing was established in 2012. In 2015, Berkeley and its sister campus, UCSF, established the
Innova tive Genomics Institute to develop CRISPR gene editing, and, in 2020, an anonym ous donor21st centurypledged $252 million to help fund a new center for computing and data science. For the 2020 fiscal year,
Berkeley set a fundraising record, receiving over $1 billion in gifts and pledges, and two years later, it broke
that record, raising ove r $1.2 bi llion.[62][59][63][64]
Various research ethics, human rights, and animal rights advocates have been in conflict
with Berkeley. Native Americans contended with the school over repatriation of remains from
the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.[65] Student activists have urged the
university to cut financial ties with Tyson Foods and PepsiCo.[66][67][68] Faculty member
Ignacio Chapela prominently criticized the university's financial ties to Novartis.[69] PETA
has challenged the university's use of animals for research and argued that it may violate the
Animal Welfare Act.[70][71]
Cal's Memorial Stadium reopened in September 2012 after renovations. The university
incurred a controversial $445 million of debt for the stadium and a new $153 million student
athletic center, which it financed with the sale of special stadium endowment seats.[72] The
roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20 percent of Cal's
athletics' budget; principal repayment begins in 2032 and is scheduled to conclude in
2113.[73]
On May 1, 2014, Berkeley was named one of fifty-five higher education institutions under
investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights "for possible
violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by
the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.[74] Investigations
continued into 2016, with hundreds of pages of records released in April 2016, showing a
pattern of documented sexual harassment and firings of non-tenured staff.[75]
On July 25, 2019, Berkeley was removed from the U.S. News Best Colleges Ranking for
misreporting statistics. Berkeley had originally reported that its two-year average alumni
giving rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 11.6 percent, U.S. News said. The school
later told U.S. News the correct average alumni giving rate for the 2016 fiscal year was just
7.9 percent. The school incorrectly overstated its alumni giving data to U.S. News since at
least 2014. The alumni giving rate accounts for five percent of the Best Colleges ranking.[76]
Berkeley community members have criticized UC Berkeley's increasing enrollment. Berkeley residents filed a lawsuit alleging that the university's expanding enrollment violated
California Environmental Quality Act and that the area lacked the infrastructure to support
more students.[77] Critics of the lawsuit accused these community members of
NIMBYism.[78][79][80] In August 2021, a judge from the Superior Court of Alameda County
ruled in favor of the residents, and on March 3, 2022, the California Supreme Court also
ruled in favor of the residents, saying that the university needed to freeze its admission rates
at 2020â€“2021 levels.[81] On March 11, 2022, state legislators released a proposal to change
CEQA to exempt the university from its restrictions.[82] On March 14, Gavin Newsom signed
the bill into law.[83] Berkeley has continued to face a housing shortage.[84]
Officially named the "University of California, Berkeley" it is often shortened to "Berkeley" in general
reference or in an academic context (Berkeley Law, Berkeley Engineering, Berkeley Haas, Berkeley Public
Health) and to "California" or "Cal" particularly when referring to its athletic teams (California GoldenControversies
Organization and administration
NameBears).[11][12][85] In August 2022, a university task force was formed which recommended renaming the
athletic identity to "Cal Berkeley" to further tie the athletic brand to academic prestige, and reduce public
confusion.[86]
The University of California is gove rned by a twenty-six member Board of Regents, eighteen of whom are
appointed by the Governor of California to 12-year terms. The board also has seven ex officio members, a
student regent, and a non-voting student regent-designate.[87] Prior to 1952, Berkeley was the University of
California, so the university president was also Berkeley's chief executive. In 1952, the university
reorganized itself into a system of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus having its own chief
executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice-
chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the fifteen colleges and schools report
to the executive vice chancellor and provos t, Berkeley's chief academic officer.[88] Twenty-three presidents
and chancellors have led Berkeley since its foundi ng.[89][47]

The University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley,
Berkeley, Cal, or California),[11][12] is a public land-grant
research university in Berkeley, California. It was established in
1868 and is the state's first land-grant university. It is a founding
member of the Association of American Universities and is the
foundi ng campus of the University of California system. Berkeley
has the most top-ranked departments nationally and is one of the
highest-ranked uni versities worldwide.[13][14]
Berkeley is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universitiesâ€”Very
high research activity" and hosts multiple research institutes.[15] It
played a major role in the Manhattan Project and the discovery of
sixteen chemical elements. It also has three national laboratories for
the U.S. Department of Energy (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los
Alamos National Laboratory).[16] Berkeley's athletic teams (the
California Golden Bears) have won 107 national championships
and 223 O lympic medals (including 121 gol d medals).[17][18]
Among Berkeley's alumni, faculty, and researchers are 260
American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellows,[19] 190
recipients of the MacArthur Fellowship,[20] 144 members of the
National Academy of Sciences,[21] 139 Gugge nheim Fellows, 107
Nobel laureates,[22] 75 members of the National Academy of
Engineering,[23] 68 recipients of the National Medal of Science, 34
Pulitzer Prize winners, 25 Turing Award winners, 22 cabinet
members, 19 Academy Award winners, 14 Fields Medalists, 10
state gove rnors, 7 heads of state or gove rnment, 6 chief justices,[24]
and 25 living bi llionaires.[25]
Made possible by President Lincoln's signing of the Morrill Act in
1862, the University of California was founde d in 1868 as the
state's first land-grant university, inheriting the land and facilities of
the private College of California and the federal-funding eligibility
of a public agricultural, mining, and mechanical arts college.[26]
The Organic Act states that the "University shall have for its

Berkeleyin all departments of science, literature and art, indus trial and
professional pursuits, and general education, and also special
courses of instruction in preparation for the professions".[27][28]
Ten faculty members and forty male students made up the fledgling
university when it opened in Oakland in 1869.[29] Frederick
Billings, a trustee of the College of California, sugge sted that a
new campus site north of Oakland be named in honor  of Anglo-
Irish philosophe r George Berkeley.[30] The university began
admitting women the following year.[31] In 1870, Henry Durant,
founde r of the College of California, became its first president. With the completion of North and South Halls in 1873,  the
university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 22
female students.[32][33] The first female student to graduate was in
1874, a dmitted in the first class to include women in 1870.[34]
Beginning in 1891, Phoebe Apperson Hearst funde d several
programs and new buildings and, in 1898, spons ored an
international competition in Antwerp, where French architect Ã‰mile
BÃ©nard submitted the winning design for a campus master plan. Although the University of California system does not have an
official flagship campus, many scholars and experts consider
Berkeley to be its unofficial flagship. It shares this unofficial status
with the University of California, Los Angeles.[35]
In 1905, the University Farm was established near Sacramento,
ultimately becoming the University of California, Davis.[36] In
1919, Los Angeles State Normal School became the southern
branch of the university, which ultimately became the University of
California, Los Angeles.[37] By the 1920s, the number of campus
buildings in Berkeley had grown substantially and included twenty
structures designed by architect John Galen Howard.[38] In 1917,
one of the nation's first ROTC programs was established at
Berkeley[39] and its School of Military Aeronautics began training
pilots, including Jimmy Doolittle. In 1926, future Fleet Admiral
Chester W. Nimitz established the first Naval ROTC unit at
Berkeley.[40] Berkeley ROTC alumni include former Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara, Army Chief of Staff Frederick C. Weyand, sixteen other general officers, ten Navy flag officers, and
AFROTC alumna Captain Theresa Claiborne.[41]
In the 1930s , Ernest Orlando Lawrence helped establish the
Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory) and invented the cyclotron, which won him the Nobel
phys ics prize in 1939.[42] Using the cyclotron, Berkeley professors20th centurySather Tower (the Campanile) looking
out over San Francisco Bay and
Mount Tamalpaisand Berkeley Lab researchers went on to discover sixteen chemical
elementsâ€”more than any other university in the world.[43][44] In
particular, during World War II and following Glenn Seaborg's
then-secret discovery of plutonium, Lawrence's Radiation
Laboratory began to contract with the U.S. Army to develop the
atomic bomb. Physics professor J. Robert Oppenheimer was named
scientific head of the Manhattan Project in 1942.[45][46] Along with
the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley founde d and
was then a partner in managing two other labs, Los Alamos
National Laboratory (1943) and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (1952) . In 1952, the University of California reorganized itself into a system
of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus given a
chancellor, and Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first Chancellor,
while  Robert Sproul remained in place as the President of the
University of California.[47] Berkeley gained a worldwide
reputation for political activism in the 1960s. In 1964, the Free
Speech Movement organized student resistance to the university's
restrictions on political activities on campusâ€”most conspicuously, student activities related to the Civil
Rights Movement.[48][49]
The arrest in Sproul Plaza of Jack Weinberg, a recent Berkeley alumnus and chair of Campus CORE,
prompted a series of student-led acts of formal remonstrance and civil disobedience that ultimately gave rise
to the Free Speech Movement, which movement would prevail and serve as a precedent for student
oppos ition to America's involvement in the Vietnam War.[50][51][52] In 1982, the Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute (MSRI) was established on campus with suppor t from the National Science Founda tion
and at the request of three Berkeley mathematiciansâ€”Shiing-Shen Chern, Calvin Moore, and Isadore M. Singer. The institute is now widely regarded as a leading center for collaborative mathematical research,
drawing thous ands of visiting researchers from around t he world each year.[53][54][55]
In the current century, Berkeley has become less politically active, although more liberal.[56][57] Democrats
outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of nine to one, which is a ratio similar to that of American
academia generally.[58] The school has become more focused on STEM disciplines and
fundraising.[59][60][61] In 2007, the Energy Biosciences Institute was established with funding from BP and
Stanley Hall, a research facility and headqua rters for the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences,
opened. Suppor ted by a grant from alumnus James Simons, the Simons Institute for the Theory of
Computing was established in 2012. In 2015, Berkeley and its sister campus, UCSF, established the
Innova tive Genomics Institute to develop CRISPR gene editing, and, in 2020, an anonym ous donor21st centurypledged $252 million to help fund a new center for computing and data science. For the 2020 fiscal year,
Berkeley set a fundraising record, receiving over $1 billion in gifts and pledges, and two years later, it broke
that record, raising ove r $1.2 bi llion.[62][59][63][64]
Various research ethics, human rights, and animal rights advocates have been in conflict
with Berkeley. Native Americans contended with the school over repatriation of remains from
the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.[65] Student activists have urged the
university to cut financial ties with Tyson Foods and PepsiCo.[66][67][68] Faculty member
Ignacio Chapela prominently criticized the university's financial ties to Novartis.[69] PETA
has challenged the university's use of animals for research and argued that it may violate the
Animal Welfare Act.[70][71]
Cal's Memorial Stadium reopened in September 2012 after renovations. The university
incurred a controversial $445 million of debt for the stadium and a new $153 million student
athletic center, which it financed with the sale of special stadium endowment seats.[72] The
roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20 percent of Cal's
athletics' budget; principal repayment begins in 2032 and is scheduled to conclude in
2113.[73]
On May 1, 2014, Berkeley was named one of fifty-five higher education institutions under
investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights "for possible
violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by
the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.[74] Investigations
continued into 2016, with hundreds of pages of records released in April 2016, showing a
pattern of documented sexual harassment and firings of non-tenured staff.[75]
On July 25, 2019, Berkeley was removed from the U.S. News Best Colleges Ranking for
misreporting statistics. Berkeley had originally reported that its two-year average alumni
giving rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 11.6 percent, U.S. News said. The school
later told U.S. News the correct average alumni giving rate for the 2016 fiscal year was just
7.9 percent. The school incorrectly overstated its alumni giving data to U.S. News since at
least 2014. The alumni giving rate accounts for five percent of the Best Colleges ranking.[76]
Berkeley community members have criticized UC Berkeley's increasing enrollment. Berkeley residents filed a lawsuit alleging that the university's expanding enrollment violated
California Environmental Quality Act and that the area lacked the infrastructure to support
more students.[77] Critics of the lawsuit accused these community members of
NIMBYism.[78][79][80] In August 2021, a judge from the Superior Court of Alameda County
ruled in favor of the residents, and on March 3, 2022, the California Supreme Court also
ruled in favor of the residents, saying that the university needed to freeze its admission rates
at 2020â€“2021 levels.[81] On March 11, 2022, state legislators released a proposal to change
CEQA to exempt the university from its restrictions.[82] On March 14, Gavin Newsom signed
the bill into law.[83] Berkeley has continued to face a housing shortage.[84]
Officially named the "University of California, Berkeley" it is often shortened to "Berkeley" in general
reference or in an academic context (Berkeley Law, Berkeley Engineering, Berkeley Haas, Berkeley Public
Health) and to "California" or "Cal" particularly when referring to its athletic teams (California GoldenControversies
Organization and administration
NameBears).[11][12][85] In August 2022, a university task force was formed which recommended renaming the
athletic identity to "Cal Berkeley" to further tie the athletic brand to academic prestige, and reduce public
confusion.[86]
The University of California is gove rned by a twenty-six member Board of Regents, eighteen of whom are
appointed by the Governor of California to 12-year terms. The board also has seven ex officio members, a
student regent, and a non-voting student regent-designate.[87] Prior to 1952, Berkeley was the University of
California, so the university president was also Berkeley's chief executive. In 1952, the university
reorganized itself into a system of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus having its own chief
executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice-
chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the fifteen colleges and schools report
to the executive vice chancellor and provos t, Berkeley's chief academic officer.[88] Twenty-three presidents
and chancellors have led Berkeley since its foundi ng.[89][47]

The University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley,
Berkeley, Cal, or California),[11][12] is a public land-grant
research university in Berkeley, California. It was established in
1868 and is the state's first land-grant university. It is a founding
member of the Association of American Universities and is the
foundi ng campus of the University of California system. Berkeley
has the most top-ranked departments nationally and is one of the
highest-ranked uni versities worldwide.[13][14]
Berkeley is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universitiesâ€”Very
high research activity" and hosts multiple research institutes.[15] It
played a major role in the Manhattan Project and the discovery of
sixteen chemical elements. It also has three national laboratories for
the U.S. Department of Energy (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los
Alamos National Laboratory).[16] Berkeley's athletic teams (the
California Golden Bears) have won 107 national championships
and 223 O lympic medals (including 121 gol d medals).[17][18]
Among Berkeley's alumni, faculty, and researchers are 260
American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellows,[19] 190
recipients of the MacArthur Fellowship,[20] 144 members of the
National Academy of Sciences,[21] 139 Gugge nheim Fellows, 107
Nobel laureates,[22] 75 members of the National Academy of
Engineering,[23] 68 recipients of the National Medal of Science, 34
Pulitzer Prize winners, 25 Turing Award winners, 22 cabinet
members, 19 Academy Award winners, 14 Fields Medalists, 10
state gove rnors, 7 heads of state or gove rnment, 6 chief justices,[24]
and 25 living bi llionaires.[25]
Made possible by President Lincoln's signing of the Morrill Act in
1862, the University of California was founde d in 1868 as the
state's first land-grant university, inheriting the land and facilities of
the private College of California and the federal-funding eligibility
of a public agricultural, mining, and mechanical arts college.[26]

Berkeleyin all departments of science, literature and art, indus trial and
professional pursuits, and general education, and also special
courses of instruction in preparation for the professions".[27][28]
Ten faculty members and forty male students made up the fledgling
university when it opened in Oakland in 1869.[29] Frederick
Billings, a trustee of the College of California, sugge sted that a
new campus site north of Oakland be named in honor  of Anglo-
Irish philosophe r George Berkeley.[30] The university began
admitting women the following year.[31] In 1870, Henry Durant,
founde r of the College of California, became its first president. With the completion of North and South Halls in 1873,  the
university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 22
female students.[32][33] The first female student to graduate was in
1874, a dmitted in the first class to include women in 1870.[34]
Beginning in 1891, Phoebe Apperson Hearst funde d several
programs and new buildings and, in 1898, spons ored an
international competition in Antwerp, where French architect Ã‰mile
BÃ©nard submitted the winning design for a campus master plan. Although the University of California system does not have an
official flagship campus, many scholars and experts consider
Berkeley to be its unofficial flagship. It shares this unofficial status
with the University of California, Los Angeles.[35]
In 1905, the University Farm was established near Sacramento,
ultimately becoming the University of California, Davis.[36] In
1919, Los Angeles State Normal School became the southern
branch of the university, which ultimately became the University of
California, Los Angeles.[37] By the 1920s, the number of campus
buildings in Berkeley had grown substantially and included twenty
structures designed by architect John Galen Howard.[38] In 1917,
one of the nation's first ROTC programs was established at
Berkeley[39] and its School of Military Aeronautics began training
pilots, including Jimmy Doolittle. In 1926, future Fleet Admiral
Chester W. Nimitz established the first Naval ROTC unit at
Berkeley.[40] Berkeley ROTC alumni include former Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara, Army Chief of Staff Frederick C. Weyand, sixteen other general officers, ten Navy flag officers, and
AFROTC alumna Captain Theresa Claiborne.[41]
In the 1930s , Ernest Orlando Lawrence helped establish the
Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory) and invented the cyclotron, which won him the Nobel
phys ics prize in 1939.[42] Using the cyclotron, Berkeley professors20th centurySather Tower (the Campanile) looking
out over San Francisco Bay and
Mount Tamalpaisand Berkeley Lab researchers went on to discover sixteen chemical
elementsâ€”more than any other university in the world.[43][44] In
particular, during World War II and following Glenn Seaborg's
then-secret discovery of plutonium, Lawrence's Radiation
Laboratory began to contract with the U.S. Army to develop the
atomic bomb. Physics professor J. Robert Oppenheimer was named
scientific head of the Manhattan Project in 1942.[45][46] Along with
the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley founde d and
was then a partner in managing two other labs, Los Alamos
National Laboratory (1943) and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (1952) . In 1952, the University of California reorganized itself into a system
of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus given a
chancellor, and Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first Chancellor,
while  Robert Sproul remained in place as the President of the
University of California.[47] Berkeley gained a worldwide
reputation for political activism in the 1960s. In 1964, the Free
Speech Movement organized student resistance to the university's
restrictions on political activities on campusâ€”most conspicuously, student activities related to the Civil
Rights Movement.[48][49]
The arrest in Sproul Plaza of Jack Weinberg, a recent Berkeley alumnus and chair of Campus CORE,
prompted a series of student-led acts of formal remonstrance and civil disobedience that ultimately gave rise
to the Free Speech Movement, which movement would prevail and serve as a precedent for student
oppos ition to America's involvement in the Vietnam War.[50][51][52] In 1982, the Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute (MSRI) was established on campus with suppor t from the National Science Founda tion
and at the request of three Berkeley mathematiciansâ€”Shiing-Shen Chern, Calvin Moore, and Isadore M. Singer. The institute is now widely regarded as a leading center for collaborative mathematical research,
drawing thous ands of visiting researchers from around t he world each year.[53][54][55]
In the current century, Berkeley has become less politically active, although more liberal.[56][57] Democrats
outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of nine to one, which is a ratio similar to that of American
academia generally.[58] The school has become more focused on STEM disciplines and
fundraising.[59][60][61] In 2007, the Energy Biosciences Institute was established with funding from BP and
Stanley Hall, a research facility and headqua rters for the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences,
opened. Suppor ted by a grant from alumnus James Simons, the Simons Institute for the Theory of
Computing was established in 2012. In 2015, Berkeley and its sister campus, UCSF, established the
Innova tive Genomics Institute to develop CRISPR gene editing, and, in 2020, an anonym ous donor21st centurypledged $252 million to help fund a new center for computing and data science. For the 2020 fiscal year,
Berkeley set a fundraising record, receiving over $1 billion in gifts and pledges, and two years later, it broke
that record, raising ove r $1.2 bi llion.[62][59][63][64]
Various research ethics, human rights, and animal rights advocates have been in conflict
with Berkeley. Native Americans contended with the school over repatriation of remains from
the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.[65] Student activists have urged the
university to cut financial ties with Tyson Foods and PepsiCo.[66][67][68] Faculty member
Ignacio Chapela prominently criticized the university's financial ties to Novartis.[69] PETA
has challenged the university's use of animals for research and argued that it may violate the
Animal Welfare Act.[70][71]
Cal's Memorial Stadium reopened in September 2012 after renovations. The university
incurred a controversial $445 million of debt for the stadium and a new $153 million student
athletic center, which it financed with the sale of special stadium endowment seats.[72] The
roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20 percent of Cal's
athletics' budget; principal repayment begins in 2032 and is scheduled to conclude in
2113.[73]
On May 1, 2014, Berkeley was named one of fifty-five higher education institutions under
investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights "for possible
violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by
the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.[74] Investigations
continued into 2016, with hundreds of pages of records released in April 2016, showing a
pattern of documented sexual harassment and firings of non-tenured staff.[75]
On July 25, 2019, Berkeley was removed from the U.S. News Best Colleges Ranking for
misreporting statistics. Berkeley had originally reported that its two-year average alumni
giving rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 11.6 percent, U.S. News said. The school
later told U.S. News the correct average alumni giving rate for the 2016 fiscal year was just
7.9 percent. The school incorrectly overstated its alumni giving data to U.S. News since at
least 2014. The alumni giving rate accounts for five percent of the Best Colleges ranking.[76]
Berkeley community members have criticized UC Berkeley's increasing enrollment. Berkeley residents filed a lawsuit alleging that the university's expanding enrollment violated
California Environmental Quality Act and that the area lacked the infrastructure to support
more students.[77] Critics of the lawsuit accused these community members of
NIMBYism.[78][79][80] In August 2021, a judge from the Superior Court of Alameda County
ruled in favor of the residents, and on March 3, 2022, the California Supreme Court also
ruled in favor of the residents, saying that the university needed to freeze its admission rates
at 2020â€“2021 levels.[81] On March 11, 2022, state legislators released a proposal to change
CEQA to exempt the university from its restrictions.[82] On March 14, Gavin Newsom signed
the bill into law.[83] Berkeley has continued to face a housing shortage.[84]
Officially named the "University of California, Berkeley" it is often shortened to "Berkeley" in general
reference or in an academic context (Berkeley Law, Berkeley Engineering, Berkeley Haas, Berkeley Public
Health) and to "California" or "Cal" particularly when referring to its athletic teams (California GoldenControversies
Organization and administration
NameBears).[11][12][85] In August 2022, a university task force was formed which recommended renaming the
athletic identity to "Cal Berkeley" to further tie the athletic brand to academic prestige, and reduce public
confusion.[86]
The University of California is gove rned by a twenty-six member Board of Regents, eighteen of whom are
appointed by the Governor of California to 12-year terms. The board also has seven ex officio members, a
student regent, and a non-voting student regent-designate.[87] Prior to 1952, Berkeley was the University of
California, so the university president was also Berkeley's chief executive. In 1952, the university
reorganized itself into a system of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus having its own chief
executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice-
chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the fifteen colleges and schools report
to the executive vice chancellor and provos t, Berkeley's chief academic officer.[88] Twenty-three presidents
and chancellors have led Berkeley since its foundi ng.[89][47]

The University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley,
Berkeley, Cal, or California),[11][12] is a public land-grant
research university in Berkeley, California. It was established in
1868 and is the state's first land-grant university. It is a founding
member of the Association of American Universities and is the
foundi ng campus of the University of California system. Berkeley
has the most top-ranked departments nationally and is one of the
highest-ranked uni versities worldwide.[13][14]
Berkeley is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universitiesâ€”Very
high research activity" and hosts multiple research institutes.[15] It
played a major role in the Manhattan Project and the discovery of
sixteen chemical elements. It also has three national laboratories for
the U.S. Department of Energy (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los
Alamos National Laboratory).[16] Berkeley's athletic teams (the
California Golden Bears) have won 107 national championships
and 223 O lympic medals (including 121 gol d medals).[17][18]
Among Berkeley's alumni, faculty, and researchers are 260
American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellows,[19] 190
recipients of the MacArthur Fellowship,[20] 144 members of the
National Academy of Sciences,[21] 139 Gugge nheim Fellows, 107
Nobel laureates,[22] 75 members of the National Academy of
Engineering,[23] 68 recipients of the National Medal of Science, 34
Pulitzer Prize winners, 25 Turing Award winners, 22 cabinet
members, 19 Academy Award winners, 14 Fields Medalists, 10
state gove rnors, 7 heads of state or gove rnment, 6 chief justices,[24]
and 25 living bi llionaires.[25]
Made possible by President Lincoln's signing of the Morrill Act in
1862, the University of California was founde d in 1868 as the
state's first land-grant university, inheriting the land and facilities of
the private College of California and the federal-funding eligibility
of a public agricultural, mining, and mechanical arts college.[26]

Berkeleyin all departments of science, literature and art, indus trial and
professional pursuits, and general education, and also special
courses of instruction in preparation for the professions".[27][28]
Ten faculty members and forty male students made up the fledgling
university when it opened in Oakland in 1869.[29] Frederick
Billings, a trustee of the College of California, sugge sted that a
new campus site north of Oakland be named in honor  of Anglo-
Irish philosophe r George Berkeley.[30] The university began
admitting women the following year.[31] In 1870, Henry Durant,
founde r of the College of California, became its first president. With the completion of North and South Halls in 1873,  the
university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 22
female students.[32][33] The first female student to graduate was in
1874, a dmitted in the first class to include women in 1870.[34]
Beginning in 1891, Phoebe Apperson Hearst funde d several
programs and new buildings and, in 1898, spons ored an
international competition in Antwerp, where French architect Ã‰mile
BÃ©nard submitted the winning design for a campus master plan. Although the University of California system does not have an
official flagship campus, many scholars and experts consider
Berkeley to be its unofficial flagship. It shares this unofficial status
with the University of California, Los Angeles.[35]
In 1905, the University Farm was established near Sacramento,
ultimately becoming the University of California, Davis.[36] In
1919, Los Angeles State Normal School became the southern
branch of the university, which ultimately became the University of
California, Los Angeles.[37] By the 1920s, the number of campus
buildings in Berkeley had grown substantially and included twenty
structures designed by architect John Galen Howard.[38] In 1917,
one of the nation's first ROTC programs was established at
Berkeley[39] and its School of Military Aeronautics began training
pilots, including Jimmy Doolittle. In 1926, future Fleet Admiral
Chester W. Nimitz established the first Naval ROTC unit at
Berkeley.[40] Berkeley ROTC alumni include former Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara, Army Chief of Staff Frederick C. Weyand, sixteen other general officers, ten Navy flag officers, and
AFROTC alumna Captain Theresa Claiborne.[41]
In the 1930s , Ernest Orlando Lawrence helped establish the
Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory) and invented the cyclotron, which won him the Nobel
phys ics prize in 1939.[42] Using the cyclotron, Berkeley professors20th centurySather Tower (the Campanile) looking
out over San Francisco Bay and
Mount Tamalpaisand Berkeley Lab researchers went on to discover sixteen chemical
elementsâ€”more than any other university in the world.[43][44] In
particular, during World War II and following Glenn Seaborg's
then-secret discovery of plutonium, Lawrence's Radiation
Laboratory began to contract with the U.S. Army to develop the
atomic bomb. Physics professor J. Robert Oppenheimer was named
scientific head of the Manhattan Project in 1942.[45][46] Along with
the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley founde d and
was then a partner in managing two other labs, Los Alamos
National Laboratory (1943) and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (1952) . In 1952, the University of California reorganized itself into a system
of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus given a
chancellor, and Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first Chancellor,
while  Robert Sproul remained in place as the President of the
University of California.[47] Berkeley gained a worldwide
reputation for political activism in the 1960s. In 1964, the Free
Speech Movement organized student resistance to the university's
restrictions on political activities on campusâ€”most conspicuously, student activities related to the Civil
Rights Movement.[48][49]
The arrest in Sproul Plaza of Jack Weinberg, a recent Berkeley alumnus and chair of Campus CORE,
prompted a series of student-led acts of formal remonstrance and civil disobedience that ultimately gave rise
to the Free Speech Movement, which movement would prevail and serve as a precedent for student
oppos ition to America's involvement in the Vietnam War.[50][51][52] In 1982, the Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute (MSRI) was established on campus with suppor t from the National Science Founda tion
and at the request of three Berkeley mathematiciansâ€”Shiing-Shen Chern, Calvin Moore, and Isadore M. Singer. The institute is now widely regarded as a leading center for collaborative mathematical research,
drawing thous ands of visiting researchers from around t he world each year.[53][54][55]
In the current century, Berkeley has become less politically active, although more liberal.[56][57] Democrats
outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of nine to one, which is a ratio similar to that of American
academia generally.[58] The school has become more focused on STEM disciplines and
fundraising.[59][60][61] In 2007, the Energy Biosciences Institute was established with funding from BP and
Stanley Hall, a research facility and headqua rters for the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences,
opened. Suppor ted by a grant from alumnus James Simons, the Simons Institute for the Theory of
Computing was established in 2012. In 2015, Berkeley and its sister campus, UCSF, established the
Innova tive Genomics Institute to develop CRISPR gene editing, and, in 2020, an anonym ous donor21st centurypledged $252 million to help fund a new center for computing and data science. For the 2020 fiscal year,
Berkeley set a fundraising record, receiving over $1 billion in gifts and pledges, and two years later, it broke
that record, raising ove r $1.2 bi llion.[62][59][63][64]
Various research ethics, human rights, and animal rights advocates have been in conflict
with Berkeley. Native Americans contended with the school over repatriation of remains from
the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.[65] Student activists have urged the
university to cut financial ties with Tyson Foods and PepsiCo.[66][67][68] Faculty member
Ignacio Chapela prominently criticized the university's financial ties to Novartis.[69] PETA
has challenged the university's use of animals for research and argued that it may violate the
Animal Welfare Act.[70][71]
Cal's Memorial Stadium reopened in September 2012 after renovations. The university
incurred a controversial $445 million of debt for the stadium and a new $153 million student
athletic center, which it financed with the sale of special stadium endowment seats.[72] The
roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20 percent of Cal's
athletics' budget; principal repayment begins in 2032 and is scheduled to conclude in
2113.[73]
On May 1, 2014, Berkeley was named one of fifty-five higher education institutions under
investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights "for possible
violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by
the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.[74] Investigations
continued into 2016, with hundreds of pages of records released in April 2016, showing a
pattern of documented sexual harassment and firings of non-tenured staff.[75]
On July 25, 2019, Berkeley was removed from the U.S. News Best Colleges Ranking for
misreporting statistics. Berkeley had originally reported that its two-year average alumni
giving rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 11.6 percent, U.S. News said. The school
later told U.S. News the correct average alumni giving rate for the 2016 fiscal year was just
7.9 percent. The school incorrectly overstated its alumni giving data to U.S. News since at
least 2014. The alumni giving rate accounts for five percent of the Best Colleges ranking.[76]
Berkeley community members have criticized UC Berkeley's increasing enrollment. Berkeley residents filed a lawsuit alleging that the university's expanding enrollment violated
California Environmental Quality Act and that the area lacked the infrastructure to support
more students.[77] Critics of the lawsuit accused these community members of
NIMBYism.[78][79][80] In August 2021, a judge from the Superior Court of Alameda County
ruled in favor of the residents, and on March 3, 2022, the California Supreme Court also
ruled in favor of the residents, saying that the university needed to freeze its admission rates
at 2020â€“2021 levels.[81] On March 11, 2022, state legislators released a proposal to change
CEQA to exempt the university from its restrictions.[82] On March 14, Gavin Newsom signed
the bill into law.[83] Berkeley has continued to face a housing shortage.[84]
Officially named the "University of California, Berkeley" it is often shortened to "Berkeley" in general
reference or in an academic context (Berkeley Law, Berkeley Engineering, Berkeley Haas, Berkeley Public
Health) and to "California" or "Cal" particularly when referring to its athletic teams (California GoldenControversies
Organization and administration
NameBears).[11][12][85] In August 2022, a university task force was formed which recommended renaming the
athletic identity to "Cal Berkeley" to further tie the athletic brand to academic prestige, and reduce public
confusion.[86]
The University of California is gove rned by a twenty-six member Board of Regents, eighteen of whom are
appointed by the Governor of California to 12-year terms. The board also has seven ex officio members, a
student regent, and a non-voting student regent-designate.[87] Prior to 1952, Berkeley was the University of
California, so the university president was also Berkeley's chief executive. In 1952, the university
reorganized itself into a system of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus having its own chief
executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice-
chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the fifteen colleges and schools report
to the executive vice chancellor and provos t, Berkeley's chief academic officer.[88] Twenty-three presidents
and chancellors have led Berkeley since its foundi ng.[89][47]

California, so the university president was also Berkeley's chief executive. In 1952, the university
reorganized itself into a system of semi-autonom ous campuses, with each campus having its own chief
executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice-
chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the fifteen colleges and schools report
to the executive vice chancellor and provos t, Berkeley's chief academic officer.[88] Twenty-three presidents
and chancellors have led Berkeley since its foundi ng.[89][47]
